# Zombies vs Humans

This is a simple shiny app to demonstrate how predator/prey populations change in a simple Lotka-Volterra model. In this model, the predators are zombies, and the prey are humans. I use this when speaking to kids about coding.

See [here](https://stevelane.shinyapps.io/zombies-humans/) for an online version.
